Project: Recipes

The purpose of this project is to create a basic website that will link
to the recipes of 3 different dishes, with pictures and ingredients.

Throughout this project, I used lists, anchors, images, as well as got
a lot of practice formatting my code in order to have it present as
intended on my website
